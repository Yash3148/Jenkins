Jenkins is an open-source automation server that is widely used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) processes in software development. It allows developers to automate the building, testing, and deployment of their applications, providing a robust and reliable framework for managing the software development lifecycle.

With Jenkins, developers can set up pipelines that define the steps required to build, test, and deploy their applications. These pipelines are typically written as code and stored in a version control system, enabling teams to manage and version their build and deployment processes alongside their application code.

Jenkins integrates with various version control systems, such as Git, and can be configured to monitor changes in the repository. When changes are detected, Jenkins can automatically trigger the defined pipeline, which typically involves fetching the latest code, compiling/building the application, running tests, and deploying the application to a target environment.

Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins that extend its functionality, enabling integration with different tools and technologies. These plugins allow you to integrate Jenkins with issue tracking systems, code quality analysis tools, containerization platforms, cloud providers, and more.

Overall, Jenkins helps streamline the software development process by automating repetitive tasks, providing real-time feedback on the status of builds and deployments, and facilitating collaboration among team members. It has a large and active community, which contributes to its flexibility, extensibility, and continuous improvement.

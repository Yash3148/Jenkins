To install the Jenkins CLI (jenkins-cli.jar) on Ubuntu using the command line, follow the steps below:

1. Open the terminal on your Ubuntu machine.
2. Ensure that Java is installed by running the following command:
$java -version

If Java is not installed, you can install it using the command:
$sudo apt-get install default-jre

3. Download the Jenkins CLI JAR file using curl:
$curl -O https://YOUR_JENKINS_URL/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar

Replace YOUR_JENKINS_URL with the actual URL of your Jenkins server. For example, if your Jenkins server is running on http://localhost:8080, the command would be:
$curl -O http://localhost:8080/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar

4. Verify that the JAR file was downloaded successfully by listing the files in the current directory:
$ls

5. Now you can use the Jenkins CLI JAR file to interact with your Jenkins server. For example, you can check the version of Jenkins by running the following command:
$java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://YOUR_JENKINS_URL/ version

Replace YOUR_JENKINS_URL with the actual URL of your Jenkins server.

Note: Make sure you have the correct URL of your Jenkins server and the necessary permissions to access it before running the commands.
